# Bugs
Mongoose throws uncaught exception when a validation error occurs
Express returns uncool error messages to the client when a url argument can not be parsed, e.g. caused by invalid characters like !"§$%
Move the window size reset to another location to fix the click-through bug.. again..
Save ship in the editor before upload to trigger the thumbnail generation
 - craft and thumbnail can get out of sync, find out how this can happen
 - maybe try generating the thumbnails manually again

# Todo
Move settings to a separate window which is opened via a button on the main window
 Open the settings window automatically when no configuration is found
 Add "maybe check the settings" to the error message
Fix that damn "Failed to load." bug
More details about the ships in the list
Download thumbnail and craft on select not with the list
Transfer of the thumbnails should be binary not schtring

# Ideas
Add features to make a public server feasible:
 - Authentication required to upload a ship: simple username/password should be sufficient
 - Authentication required to delete a ship: Limit deletion to the users own ships
 - Add a version check to the api to ensure old clients realize that they are old
Add sorting and filtering to the table
Build multiple thumbnails to animate a rotating ship in the preview
Add an Ember-Website which also consumes the REST service to display crafts
 - start with a simple read-only list and details page, just like the window in KSP
