# Bugs
Mongoose throws uncaught exception when a validation error occurs, currently just fixed with a workaround

# Todo
More details about the ships in the list
 - Information from the used parts would be great

# Ideas
Add features to make a public server feasible:
 - Add a version check to the api to ensure old clients realize that they are old
Add sorting and filtering to the table
Build multiple thumbnails to animate a rotating ship in the preview
Add an Ember-Website which also consumes the REST service to display crafts
 - start with a simple read-only list and details page, just like the window in KSP
