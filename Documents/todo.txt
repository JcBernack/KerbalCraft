# Bugs
Mongoose throws uncaught exception when a validation error occurs, currently just fixed with a workaround
Maybe refactor the window handling to not use the RenderingManager anymore but instead use the OnGUI event of CraftListMod
Save ship in the editor before upload to trigger the thumbnail generation
 - craft and thumbnail can get out of sync, find out how this can happen
 - maybe try generating the thumbnails manually again

# Todo
Fix that damn "Failed to load." bug
More details about the ships in the list
Download thumbnail and craft on select not with the list
Transfer of the thumbnails should be binary not schtring

# Ideas
Add features to make a public server feasible:
 - Authentication required to upload a ship: simple username/password should be sufficient
 - Authentication required to delete a ship: Limit deletion to the users own ships
 - Add a version check to the api to ensure old clients realize that they are old
Add sorting and filtering to the table
Build multiple thumbnails to animate a rotating ship in the preview
Add an Ember-Website which also consumes the REST service to display crafts
 - start with a simple read-only list and details page, just like the window in KSP
